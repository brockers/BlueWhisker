## Notes

## What's the point?

Surveying. This is to assist students with learning to use survey equipment.

3D?

Total station - measures angle and distance, used for measuring horizontal layout.

Iron rods - mark the property corners

What's the prism for? What's a backsight?

**Wants to avoid the initial fear of surveying by hand**

Some Terminology

* CP1 - Occupied point - where you total station is
* CP2 - Backsight/Prism - zero (ø) point for the prism
* Line between these two points is called a "Zero line"

On a site plan, it will give a dimension from the "zero line", or property line.

### User stories

1. ~~Leave 'stake' point (SP)~~
  * needs a label
2. ~~Fine tuning~~
  * angle
  * distance
  * reset button
  * 20" at a time?
  * arrow keys
  * buttons on screen
3. ~~Timer~~
4. level 2
  * layout a 25'x25' square, from control points
  * set **2** stake points (SP)
5. ~~level 3~~
  * layout a 25'x25' square, with control points not on the square
  * set **4** stake points (SP)
  * Occupied point is not one of the stakes

### Questions

* Q: Is there an objective to win the game?
  * You earn points, so you can compare against yourself, and to others (leaderboard). Doesn't know about "winning" the game.

* Q: Is this to learn layout or use the tools?
  * Both. Mostly about learning the layout, but also understanding how to use the tools.

* Q: Is what you are measuring from, set?
  * Yes, CP1 and CP2, are set for the first couple of levels

* Q: Is fine tuning for distance good as well?
  * Yes.

* Q: Do you use Bearing or a 360º measures?
  * For this, 360º measurements
